# Corpus Selection Rationale — Step 2

## Purpose

Step 2 converts the uploaded source inventory into a formal author/work map for the main research corpus.

The target paper is:

> **Authorial Style Separability Loss in LLM-Rewritten Fiction: A Controlled Stylometric Framework for Measuring Literary Style Flattening**

The corpus must support controlled comparison across six literary authors while avoiding genre confounds. Therefore, the main dataset should use **English prose fiction**, not poetry, drama, essays, travel writing, letters, biography, or mixed editorial material.

## Locked authors

The six target authors remain:

1. Jane Austen
2. Edgar Allan Poe
3. Mark Twain
4. Oscar Wilde
5. Charles Dickens
6. Mary Shelley

These authors are kept because they support distinct literary-style anchors:

| Author | Style anchor for later interpretation |
|---|---|
| Jane Austen | irony-bearing syntax, social narration, clause control |
| Edgar Allan Poe | punctuation intensity, suspense rhythm, heightened diction |
| Mark Twain | colloquial rhythm, informal prose, speech-like movement |
| Oscar Wilde | aphoristic compression, wit, balanced phrasing |
| Charles Dickens | descriptive accumulation, long syntactic build-up |
| Mary Shelley | Gothic register, elevated diction, emotional abstraction |

## Inclusion rules

A work is eligible for the main corpus if it is:

- prose fiction,
- public-domain or source-provided for research processing,
- long enough to support 450–650 word passage extraction,
- not primarily drama, poetry, essays, letters, travel writing, biography, or editorial commentary,
- extractable into reasonably clean text,
- not collaborative unless used only as an explicit backup.

## Planned main sources by author

### Jane Austen

Current uploaded source:

- `source/austenJane/_OceanofPDF.com_Complete_Works_Extras_-_Austen_Jane_compressed.pdf`

Initial PDF inspection confirms a complete-works table of contents containing Austen's major novels. Main candidates:

- *Pride and Prejudice* — main
- *Emma* — main

Backups:

- *Sense and Sensibility*
- *Mansfield Park*
- *Persuasion*
- *Northanger Abbey*

Rationale: Austen is retained for irony-bearing syntax, social narration, and controlled clause structure. Exact internal work boundaries must be extracted in later steps.

### Charles Dickens

Current uploaded sources include many individual Dickens PDFs. Main candidates:

- *Great Expectations*
- *Oliver Twist*

Backups:

- *David Copperfield*
- *A Tale of Two Cities*
- *Bleak House*
- *Hard Times*
- *Dombey and Son*
- *Martin Chuzzlewit*
- *Our Mutual Friend*
- *Barnaby Rudge*
- *Nicholas Nickleby*
- *Little Dorrit*

Excluded or deferred:

- *American Notes* — non-fiction/travel
- *A House to Let* — collaborative
- *The Mystery of Edwin Drood* — unfinished
- *Sketches by Boz* — sketch/mixed form; backup only if scope changes
- *Master Humphrey's Clock* — serial frame/mixed form; backup only if needed

Rationale: Dickens is retained for descriptive accumulation and long syntactic build-up. Main candidates are individual novel PDFs with sufficient length.

### Edgar Allan Poe

Current uploaded source:

- `source/EdgarPoe/the-complete-works-of-edgar-allan-poe.pdf`

Main candidate:

- selected prose fiction tales

Backup:

- *The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket*

Excluded:

- poems
- essays/reviews

Rationale: Poe is retained for punctuation intensity, suspense rhythm, and heightened diction. Because Poe wrote many short works, later steps must define a balanced short-fiction selection instead of sampling poetry or criticism.

### Mark Twain

Current uploaded source:

- `source/Marktwain/completeworksofm09twaiiala.pdf`

Initial PDF text indicates:

- *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*

Main candidate:

- *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*

Gap:

- *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer* is desired as a second prose source but is not confirmed in the current uploaded PDF.

Rationale: Twain is retained for colloquial rhythm and speech-like prose. Current source may be enough for 60 passages, but relying on one work creates a balance risk.

### Mary Shelley

Current uploaded source:

- `source/Marryshelly/delphi-complete-works-of-mary-shelley-mary-shelley-_shelley_-mary_-2013-Delphi-Classics-147fa34700ef.pdf`

Initial PDF inspection confirms a complete-works table of contents. Main candidates:

- *Frankenstein* 1818 version
- *The Last Man*

Backups:

- *Valperga*
- *Lodore*
- *Falkner*
- short stories if needed

Excluded:

- travel writing
- non-fiction
- biographies
- poems
- adaptations by other authors

Rationale: Shelley is retained for Gothic register, elevated diction, emotional abstraction, and philosophical/introspective prose.

### Oscar Wilde

Current uploaded source:

- `source/Oscarwilde/Complete works of Oscar Wilde (1921) 6.pdf`

Initial PDF inspection shows this source begins with *Lady Windermere's Fan* and appears to be a drama volume. Since the main study is prose fiction, this current source is not suitable for the main corpus.

Required source gap:

- *The Picture of Dorian Gray* should be added as the preferred Wilde prose source.

Desired backup:

- *Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and Other Stories* or another Wilde prose-fiction source.

Rationale: Wilde is retained conceptually for aphoristic compression, wit, and balanced phrasing, but the current uploaded source does not meet the main prose-fiction corpus criteria.

## Main corpus strategy after Step 2

The target remains:

\[
6 \text{ authors} \times 60 \text{ passages} = 360 \text{ original passages}
\]

Each passage should be:

\[
450-650 \text{ words}
\]

The preferred main works are:

| Author | Preferred source(s) |
|---|---|
| Austen | *Pride and Prejudice*, *Emma* |
| Dickens | *Great Expectations*, *Oliver Twist* |
| Poe | Selected prose tales; backup: *Arthur Gordon Pym* |
| Twain | *Huckleberry Finn*; desired backup: *Tom Sawyer* |
| Shelley | *Frankenstein* 1818, *The Last Man* |
| Wilde | **source gap:** add *The Picture of Dorian Gray* |

## Important Step 2 finding

The corpus is mostly viable, but Wilde is not yet source-complete. The uploaded Wilde PDF appears to contain drama, not prose fiction. This should be fixed before final passage extraction.

## Files created in Step 2

- `metadata/author_work_map.csv`
- `metadata/source_item_review.csv`
- `docs/corpus_selection_rationale.md`
- `logs/step_02_status.md`

## Next step

Step 3 should preserve and verify raw/extracted text states, including rechecking failed text extraction files and preparing reliable checksums for the extractable corpus.
