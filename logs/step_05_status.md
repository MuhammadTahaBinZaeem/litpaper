## What Step 5 did

Step 5 validates that Step 4 cleaning did not damage style-bearing signals needed for later passage extraction and stylometric analysis.

The validation checks whole cleaned source texts, not final passages. It focuses on style-relevant proxies:

- word retention
- punctuation density
- sentence count
- sentence-length rhythm
- long-sentence ratio
- comma density
- semicolon density
- dash density
- quotation density
- apostrophe/contraction density
- archaic markers
- abstract/elevated lexical suffix markers

## Validation run result

- sources validated: 29
- eligible/non-excluded sources validated: 24
- excluded sources tracked but not treated as main corpus: 5
- validation-flagged sources: 0

## Author-level results

| Author | Validated source count | Result |
|---|---:|---|
| Austen | 1 | pass |
| Dickens | 19 | pass |
| Poe | 1 | pass |
| Shelley | 1 | pass |
| Twain | 1 | pass |
| Wilde | 1 | pass |

## Important interpretation

The Step 5 pass means the conservative cleaner did not visibly or metrically damage whole-source style-bearing signals. It does **not** mean the final passage dataset is ready yet.

The following tasks remain for later steps:

- complete-works boundary extraction,
- final passage extraction,
- passage-level balance checks,
- final author/work inclusion decisions,
- source-provenance improvement before final submission.

## Author-specific notes

- Austen retains punctuation density, quotation structure, and controlled sentence rhythm.
- Dickens retains long-sentence structure, comma density, quotation material, and descriptive-rhythm signals.
- Poe retains punctuation density, dash/semicolon material, and sentence-rhythm variation.
- Shelley retains long sentence structure, punctuation, and abstract/elevated lexical markers.
- Twain retains quotation and apostrophe/contraction signals needed for colloquial-rhythm checks, but remains one-work limited.
- Wilde has one usable prose-fiction source; excluded drama/retelling sources remain tracked but not allowed into the main corpus.

## Script used

The validation script is:

```text
scripts/02_validate_cleaning.py
```

Run command used locally:

```bash
python scripts/02_validate_cleaning.py \
  --source-id-map metadata/source_id_map.csv \
  --cleaning-report logs/cleaning_report.csv \
  --cleaned-dir cleaned_books \
  --metrics-out metadata/cleaning_validation_metrics.csv \
  --author-summary-out metadata/author_style_validation_summary.csv \
  --report-out logs/cleaning_validation_report.md
```

## Step 5 completion judgment

Step 5 is complete. The cleaned text layer is validated enough to proceed to Step 6, where the formal passage extraction protocol must be defined.

## Next step

Step 6 should create the passage extraction protocol, including exact word-length rules, passage boundary rules, genre exclusions, complete-works boundary handling, overlap prevention, and metadata fields for candidate passages.
